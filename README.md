          is provided. The given content is played at the time where the word is said.
        - This project is inspired by https://youglish.com/, which does the same thing with youtube videos, but tweeking a bit adding the meaning of the videos and all deferent versons and verbs or it and there videos.

    Target Audience:
        - Language learners and educators. This will help students hear a given word being pronounced and used by native
          speakers in a practical context, making it a useful resource for educators too.

    Features:
        - Search Functionality: Allow users to search for content based on keywords.
        - Playback: Stream all the content that is found directly, at the given time where the keywords are used.
